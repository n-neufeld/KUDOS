A peer-to-peer social media celebration platform to praise those you work with!

It's fair to say what makes the job great are the people you work with. KUDOS is a mobile application that allows employees to congratulate fellow peers at any moment throughout your day.

Words are great, but what makes KUDOS unique are the art that go with each KUDO. No two images are the same, and they're completely original.
